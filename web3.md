# Web 3.0 Characteristics

## Semantic Web
The Semantic Web improves the abilities of web technologies to generate, share and connect content through search and analysis by understanding the meaning of words rather than by keywords or numbers.

## Artificial Intelligence
By combining semantic capabilities with natural language processing, computers can understand information on a human-like level to provide faster and more relevant results. In doing so, they become more intelligent and better satisfy the needs of users.

## 3D Graphics
Three-dimensional design is used extensively in websites and services in Web 3.0. Museum guides, computer games, e-commerce, geospatial contexts and more are all common examples of this.

## Connectivity
With Web 3.0, information is more connected thanks to semantic metadata. As a result, the user experience evolves into a new level of connectivity that leverages all available information.

## Ubiquity
Internet content and services can be accessed anywhere at any time via any number of devices, rather than exclusively via computers and smartphones. Web 2.0 is already ubiquitous in many ways, but the growth of IoT devices will take it to new levels.

## Blockchain
With blockchain technology, user data is protected and encrypted. This prevents large companies from controlling and/or using usersâ€™ personal data for their gain.

## Decentralized
Decentralized data networks store data within a peer-to-peer interconnection. Users maintain ownership over their data and digital assets and are able to log in securely over the internet without being tracked.

## Edge Computing
Web 3.0 relies on the advance of edge computing in which apps and data are processed at the network edge on devices such as mobile phones, laptops, appliances, sensors and even smart cars.
